# Guvi Project_1
## Redbus Data Scraping with Selenium &amp; Dynamic Filtering using Streamlit

### MOTIVE
The main motive of this project is to Scrape the Bus Transportation data from "REDBUS" website by providing a comprehensive solution for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing bus travel data. Leveraging Selenium for web scraping, it automates the extraction of detailed information from Redbus, such as bus routes, schedules, prices, and seat availability. This streamlined data collection, combined with powerful tools for data-driven decision-making, aims to significantly enhance operational efficiency and strategic planning within the transportation sector, leading to improved services and better resource management.

### EXPLAINATION
In this project, I have used several tools like Python, Selenium, Pandas, MySQL, and Streamlit to scrape data from the Redbus website, including bus routes, bus names, prices, ratings, and more, and consolidate the information for all states into a single webpage. This makes it easy for passengers to book their tickets with one click and view comprehensive details in one place.

**Python** serves as the primary programming language to tie all these tools together.

**Selenium** automates web browsers, simulating human interactions such as clicking buttons, filling out forms, and navigating pages to collect the necessary data.

**Pandas** transforms the dataset from CSV format into a structured dataframe, allowing for data manipulation, cleaning, and preprocessing to ensure it is ready for analysis.

**MySQL** establishes a connection to a SQL database, facilitating seamless integration and efficient insertion of data into relevant tables for storage and retrieval. 

Finally, Streamlit is used to develop an interactive web application, providing a user-friendly framework for data visualization and analysis, combining data from all states to enhance user convenience.
